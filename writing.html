                <h2 class="titulo">Writing conclusion</h2>

                <br>

                <p>I think that my biggest mistake is that I have not practiced many writings in my life, so I should do more of them. </p>

                <br>

                <p>Another mistake has to do with syntax, more related to my native lenguage, instead of my english writing skills, because I write many commas and very few full-stops.</p> 
                    
                <br>

                <p>Finally the last mistake, in these writings in particular, is that I do not use different tenses. Since I do not know enough english and I do not usually practice it.</p>

                <h2 class="titulo">Writing 1 corrected</h2>
                <br>
                <p> <strong>A person you knew in the past and an exciting adventure you lived with him.</strong> </p>
                <br>
                <p>I went to the ´silo´ for the first time with a friend, I <span style="color: red;"> didn't </span>  know anyone there, but there was a man who approached us and began to help us and introduce us to calisthenics, he was Javi, the Spanish calisthenics champion, he introduced us to the other people, and we became very good friends.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>Then, last year, we decided to go to a competition in Cadiz, it was a competition in pairs, at first we got up a little late and almost missed the bus, then the bus left us quite far from where we wanted to go, and we had to walk a lot.</p>
                <br>
                <p>But finally we arrived and although we <span style="color: red;"> were seconds</span>  it was a great experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We won the second prize</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">The writing is not bad with a few mistakes:</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">You use VERY LONG SENTENCES, with LOTS OF COMMAS, but  it is better to use the full-stop to make it shorter and so introduce the connectors.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">The first paragraph must be shorter than the second one (the introduction shorter than the action itself).</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">You have to use different past tenses (not just only the past simple) and adverbs to make the writing more attractive and exciting.</p>
                <br>

                <p> <strong>The Buy Nothing day</strong> </p>
                <br>
                <p>This is a day in which a group of people gather and protest against consumerism. They do that <span style="color: red;"> by</span> buying nothing for a day and with a demonstration.</p> 
                <br>
                <p style="color: blue;" >The objective is to make people aware of the wasteful habits in the developed world.</p>
                <br>
                <p>First of all, <span style="color: red;">from my point of view,</span>  people <span style="color: red;">are used to</span>  buy more than needed and being aware of it could help them to contrli it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, I totally disagree with these people because to my mind, manifesting in the street and disturbing people to raise awareness of it is not the right way to do it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To conclude, it is important to raise awareness in people of different aspects but with the adequate way. Since this year demonstrations are forbidden, the only way to participate in this day is by buying nothing.</p>
                <br>
                <ol style="margin-left: 30px; color: red;">
                    <li>
                        To (Purpose).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The sentence in blue MUST be in the forst paragraph…INCLUDING your opinion about the topic IN FAVOUR or NOT.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        `from my point of view´ must be in the first paragraph.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        To be used to BUYING.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">Paying attention to the distribution of ideas in the CORRECT paragraphs, the essay is quite better than the previous one.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">Go on this way!</p>

                <p>In the first writing I have raised the note and improved some mistakes that I made before.
                    Although in the second it was worse since I did not have time to do the writing well, so I made some mistakes again.
                    I also still don't use different verb tenses, which makes my writing simple.</p>

                <h2 class="titulo"> Remote learning </h2>
                <br>
                <p>We live in a world in which the remote learning is litle by litle becoming more common in the society.<span style="color: red;">Since</span> the circumstances that we are going through and the advancement of technology encourages to use more.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>One of the main advantages is <span style="color: red;">that help</span> the student and the teacher to teach the class without having to leave their own home. <span style="color: red;"> Another advantage is that </span> the student with the teacher's permission can record the class and watch it later.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Also <span style="color: red;">has</span> some negative aspect, such as <span style="color: red;">that</span> if the classes are not well prepared <span style="color: blue;">to take place like this, by the school</span>, it may not be heard well, the connection is bad, it does not look good, etc.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From my point of view the government should promote <span style="color: red;">these types of class</span>, since this is a very good option for the times we are in, and because it is a great evolution for the future.</p>

                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">The writing is well distributed into paragraphs but maybe you must use a wider range of connectors to make it more attractive. Apart from that, be careful with the mistakes you made.</p>

                <h2 class="titulo">Economic development: A solution or cause of poverty?</h2>
                <br>
                <p>Currently it is claimed that we live in a world in which very few people have a lot of money and many people do not have <span style="color: red;">enough, however</span> there are both arguments for and against it</p> 
                <br>
                <p></p>One of the main advantages of economic development is that it lets us live better.</p>
                <br>
                <p> <span style="color: red;">Another advantage</span> is that it makes more workplaces for everyone</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the opposite side, although there are many developed countries in the world, there are still a lot of poor countries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Taking everything into account, from my point of view, the economic development is not a cause of poverty at all, but a solution. Since, as we see in developed countries, it is the way for the well-being of the society.</p>
                <br>

                </ol>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;">The essay has a good structure (only a mistake not joining the advantages of the topic using Besides/Furthermore). YOu can introduce a TOPIC SENTENCE in each paragraph to develop it later.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="color: red;"> Also, different tenses must be used, not just the present simple one.</p>
